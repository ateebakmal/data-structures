<h1>Defination:</h1>
<p>A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers(entity that point to the next element)
In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list. 
</p>


### Some important terms in Linked List DS 
1. Node/Link/Element/Object - Each node in the linked list consists of 2 parts -
 - data 
 - link to the next node
2. Next - This points to the next node/element in the linked list (since they are not stored in a contiguous memory locations)


### Following are the standard Linked List Operations - 
1. Traversing a linked list.
2. Append a new node (to the end) of a list
3. Prepend a new node (to the beginning) of the list
4. Inserting a new node to a specific position on the list
5. Deleting a node from the list


### Types of Linked List -
1. Singly Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List
3. Circular Linked List

### Applications of Linked List - 
1. Linked Lists can be used to implement Stacks , Queues.
2. Linked Lists can also be used to implement Graphs. (Adjacency list representation of Graph).
3. Implementing Hash Tables :- Each Bucket of the hash table can itself be a linked list. (Open chain hashing).
4. Undo functionality in Photoshop or Word . Linked list of states
