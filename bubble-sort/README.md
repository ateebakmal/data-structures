**Time Complexity** : O(n^2)

**Bubble Sort is Adaptive:** You can stop the sorting as soon as the array is sorted using a flag.

**Bubble Sort is Stable:** It can handle duplicate values.

**Some important points about Bubble Sort**:
1. With every pass the largest element goes to end.
2. After 1 pass the largest element is at the end. After 2 passes 2 largest elements are in the end. Meaning you can find n largest elements easily using this. For example: You can find three largest elements in an array using 3 passes of bubble sort.
